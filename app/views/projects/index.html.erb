            made with React.js, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, CSS, and SQL.
            It allows visitors to check out images that our community has
            uploaded and see user profiles with images that they've posted,
            as well as images that they've liked. In addition to profile pages
            and photo uploading capabilities, members get an additional
            photo feed of users that they follow. The images are stored via AWS
            to reduce file size.<br><br>
