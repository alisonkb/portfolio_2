            <h3>PXCO:</h3>
          <p>PXCO is a social photo sharing application based on VSCO
            made with React.js, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, CSS, and SQL.
            It allows visitors to check out images that our community has
            uploaded and see user profiles with images that they've posted,
            as well as images that they've liked. In addition to profile pages
            and photo uploading capabilities, members get an additional
            photo feed of users that they follow. The images are stored via AWS
          to reduce file size.

          <p>Go, Budgie, Go! is a game about my dog Budgie's adventure through
          Brooklyn as he chases down a squirrel! Your task is to help him
          jump over the many obstacles that stand in your way, such as garbage bins,
          hot dog carts, and more! This game was made with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5
          canvas.</p>
